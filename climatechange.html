        Introduction
    </h3>
    <p>
        Climate change is a pressing global issue that has been the focus of extensive scientific research and public discourse in recent years. 
        The primary drivers of climate change are human activities that release large amounts of greenhouse gases, such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, which trap heat and cause the overall temperature of the planet to rise. 
        This warming trend, often referred to as global warming, leads to a wide range of impacts, including rising sea levels, more frequent and intense extreme weather events, shifts in precipitation patterns, and threats to ecosystems and human health. 
        The effects of climate change are being observed worldwide, and scientists warn that if significant actions are not taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the changing climate, the impacts are likely to become more severe in the coming decades. 
        Addressing this complex challenge requires a coordinated global effort involving governments, businesses, and individuals to transition to more sustainable practices and technologies.

<h2>
    Here is a table summarizing some key information about climate change;
</h2>
<table>
    <tr>
      <th>Characteristic</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Greenhouse Gases</td>
      <td>The primary greenhouse gases driving climate change are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and fluorinated gases. These gases trap heat in the atmosphere, causing global temperatures to rise.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Temperature Increase</td>
      <td>Average global temperatures have increased by about 1.1째C (2째F) since the late 19th century. This warming trend is projected to continue, with further increases of 1.5-4째C (2.7-7.2째F) by the end of the 21st century depending on future emissions.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Sea Level Rise</td>
      <td>Global average sea levels have risen by about 20 cm (8 inches) since the late 19th century. Sea levels are projected to rise by 30-60 cm (12-24 inches) by 2100, with the potential for even higher increases under certain scenarios.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Extreme Weather</td>
      <td>The frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as heat waves, droughts, floods, and hurricanes, have increased due to climate change. These events are expected to become more severe in the future.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Impacts on Ecosystems</td>
      <td>Climate change is causing shifts in the ranges and behavior of plant and animal species, leading to the disruption of ecosystems and increased risk of species extinctions. Coral reefs, Arctic environments, and many other sensitive ecosystems are particularly vulnerable.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Societal Impacts</td>
      <td>Climate change impacts water and food security, human health, infrastructure, and economic activities. Vulnerable populations, such as the poor and marginalized communities, are disproportionately affected.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Mitigation Strategies</td>
      <td>Reducing greenhouse gas emissions through the transition to renewable energy, energy efficiency, and sustainable land use practices is crucial to mitigate the long-term impacts of climate change.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Adaptation Strategies</td>
      <td>Adapting to the unavoidable impacts of climate change, such as through improved disaster preparedness, infrastructure resilience, and ecosystem-based approaches, is also necessary.</td>
    </tr>
